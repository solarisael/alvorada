# Text Effects Sandbox (In-World)

Cinza stood at the cliff edge as the dawn broke in quiet gradients.
He whispered a prayer to no one and everyone.

{{fx:cadence_soft}}"The world is heavy, but not without mercy."{{/fx}}
{{fx:whisper:1.2}}He almost smiled as the wind answered in static.{{/fx}}

{{fx:aura:1.5}}A pale ring of light gathered around his fingertips.{{/fx}}
{{fx:veil:1.3}}A memory surfaced, then dissolved before it could be held.{{/fx}}

{{fx:wiggle:1.05:1.1}}The runes danced at the edge of sight.{{/fx}}
{{fx:float:1.05:0.9}}A mote hovered where his heartbeat should be.{{/fx}}
{{fx:blur:3}}Then all of it softened into rain.{{/fx}}
