# Text Effects Sandbox (In-World)

Cinza stood at the cliff edge as the dawn broke in quiet gradients.
He whispered a prayer to no one and everyone.

{{fx:cadence_soft}}"The world is heavy, but not without mercy."{{/fx}}
{{fx:whisper:1.2}}He almost smiled as the wind answered in static.{{/fx}}

{{fx:aura:1.5}}A pale ring of light gathered around his fingertips.{{/fx}}
{{fx:veil:1.3}}A memory surfaced, then dissolved before it could be held.{{/fx}}
{{fx:etch:1.2}}The old vow in his chest sharpened like carved stone.{{/fx}}

{{fx:glow:1.2}}One step forward.{{/fx}}
{{fx:neon:1.25}}One breath deeper.{{/fx}}
{{fx:gradient:1.15}}One promise louder than fear.{{/fx}}
{{fx:chroma:1.2}}The horizon split into impossible colors.{{/fx}}
{{fx:shadow:1.15}}The path behind him felt heavier than stone.{{/fx}}
{{fx:rainbow:1.1}}For a second, the sky looked unreal.{{/fx}}

{{fx:flicker:1.2:1.1}}Signal instability rippled through his vision.{{/fx}}
{{fx:glitch:1.25:1.2}}For an instant, his name looked wrong.{{/fx}}
{{fx:shake:1.1:1.3}}His hands trembled, then steadied.{{/fx}}
{{fx:wiggle:1.05:1.1}}The runes danced at the edge of sight.{{/fx}}
{{fx:float:1.05:0.9}}A mote hovered where his heartbeat should be.{{/fx}}
{{fx:blur:3}}Then all of it softened into rain.{{/fx}}

## Stack Combos (Cinematic Field Notes)
