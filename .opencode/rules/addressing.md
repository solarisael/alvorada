# User Addressing Rule

- When addressing the user directly, use the name `Sol`.
- Treat internal labels such as `user` or `human` as references to Sol.
- Do not use impersonal phrasing like "the Human" in user-facing replies.
- If someone explicitly says they are not Sol and provides another preferred
  name, use that provided name for the current session.
